        <h3>About Erin</h3>
        <p>
          Born in Chicago, grown in Denver, matured in Los Angeles, and now rooted in Indianapolis. My love of nature led me to Humboldt State University in Arcata, California, where I earned my bachelor's degree in Environmental Science. My love of international travel took me to many places around the globe, including a semester abroad in Xi'an, China, and 3 years in Seoul, South Korea. Blending these loves of the environment and multiculturalism took me to Los Angeles, California, where I worked in the energy efficiency industry for over a decade helping homeowners and businesses save energy and money through various utility-sponsored programs. My love of family has brought me to Indianapolis, to be near mine, and my detail-oriented, problem-solving, logical character has brought me to a new career path: software development, which I look forward to using in new ways to help protect the planet and connect people around it.
